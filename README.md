## Weather-app.js :sunny: :umbrella: :cloud:

### About the project 

This project is to show my understanding of using APIs and promises via the `async` and `await` syntax. The app takes in a user input and fetches the data from OpenWeatherAPI, and then displays the information accordingly to the user. So, to get started, just enter a location within the UK and discover the weather in that location!

### Future improvements :sparkles:
- Add forecast for remainder of the week
- Add forecast for 24 hours, hour-by-hour
- General styling improvements
- Allow users to discover weather in locations outside the UK
